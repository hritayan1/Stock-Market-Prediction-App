# Stock-Market-Prediction-App


Creating a stock market prediction app using Streamlit can be a great project to learn about data analysis, machine learning, and web application development. In this example, I'll guide you through the process of creating a simple stock market prediction app using Python, Streamlit, and a basic machine learning model. Please note that this is a simplified example for educational purposes, and real stock market prediction is a complex task that requires more advanced techniques and data.

Here's a step-by-step guide to building your stock market prediction app:

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   First, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need to install Streamlit and other necessary libraries. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas yfinance scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Gather Data:**

   We'll use Yahoo Finance to fetch historical stock price data. You can use the `yfinance` library to do this. You can also add more features to your dataset, like volume, moving averages, or technical indicators for more accurate predictions.

3. **Build the Machine Learning Model:**

   For simplicity, let's use a basic machine learning model like Linear Regression. In practice, more advanced models like LSTM or XGBoost may perform better.

4. **Create the Streamlit App:**

   Now, create a Python script for your Streamlit app. Here's a basic structure:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   import pandas as pd
   import yfinance as yf
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

   # Title
   st.title("Stock Price Prediction App")

   # Sidebar
   st.sidebar.header("User Input")

   # Select a stock symbol
   stock_symbol = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple)", "AAPL")

   # Select a date range
   start_date = st.sidebar.date_input("Start date", pd.to_datetime('2020-01-01'))
   end_date = st.sidebar.date_input("End date", pd.to_datetime('2021-12-31'))

   # Fetch historical stock data
   @st.cache
   def load_data(symbol, start, end):
       data = yf.download(symbol, start=start, end=end)
       return data

   df = load_data(stock_symbol, start_date, end_date)

   # Display historical stock data
   st.write("Historical Stock Data")
   st.write(df)

   # Prepare data for prediction (e.g., using closing prices)
   X = pd.DataFrame(df['Close'])
   y = X.shift(-1)  # Shift the target variable by one day to predict the next day's closing price
   X = X[:-1]  # Remove the last row as we don't have a target value for it
   y = y[:-1]

   # Split the data into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

   # Train a simple Linear Regression model
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Make predictions
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

   # Calculate Mean Squared Error
   mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

   # Display prediction and MSE
   st.write("Predicted Closing Price for Tomorrow:")
   st.write(y_pred[-1])
   st.write(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

   # Plot historical and predicted prices
   st.line_chart(df['Close'])
   st.line_chart(pd.Series(y_pred, index=y_test.index))
   ```

5. **Run Your Streamlit App:**

   Save the script and run it using the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   streamlit run your_app_script.py
   ```

6. **Use the App:**

   Your Streamlit app should open in a web browser. You can select a stock symbol and a date range, and it will display historical stock data, make predictions for the next day's closing price, and show a chart with historical and predicted prices.

Remember that this is a simplified example, and real-world stock market prediction requires more advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. Additionally, financial markets are highly unpredictable, and even the most sophisticated models may not provide accurate predictions.
